# LinuxScripts
Scripts created for carrying out various automated tasks, made using Linux. Adjust to your needs.

# Requirements
Ensure all packages being used are installed on your system and all scripts can be exectued through their properties, for example `xdotool`, it is required for some scripts to work but may not be available to you unless installed manually (`sudo apt install xdotool`).

Some scripts were created to replace applications that run when your system starts, for example instead of having ProtonVPN as a startup application, run the script `start_protonvpn_minimized.sh` as a startup command instead.

Scripts found here were all created with minimal installation requirements, keeping them plug-and-play as much as possible.
