Scripts created to make navigating YouTube, or other sites, easier.

`open_background_link.sh` was created to make opening playlists on YouTube easier, and to not interrupt focused or fullscreen windows, can be edited to open any link in the background without having to wait or minimize the window to continue with your primary window(s).
